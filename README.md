## 👨‍💻 About me

I am a final-year Computer Science student at WSB Merito University in Wrocław, specializing in Cloud Computing Architecture.

I have hands-on experience in developing client–server applications, designing REST APIs, working with relational databases, and implementing basic security mechanisms.  
I also work with Windows, Linux and macOS systems and understand how applications interact with the operating system and runtime environment.

I am looking for a junior position in **software development** or **IT support / helpdesk**, where I can further develop my technical and system skills.
